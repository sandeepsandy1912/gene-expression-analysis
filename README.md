# gene-expression-analysis
This repository contains an end-to-end analysis of gene expression data for distinguishing between invasive and non-invasive cancer types. Using R, this project implements exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization techniques to identify significant genes and potential biomarkers.

Project Objectives

1.Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the gene expression dataset for analysis.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize the data to understand distribution and key features.
                                   Identify trends, outliers, and differences between invasive and non-invasive samples.

3.Statistical Analysis: Perform differential expression analysis to identify significant genes.
                        Apply hypothesis testing to validate findings.

4.Machine Learning: Train models to classify samples into invasive or non-invasive categories.
                    Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

5.Visualization: Create heatmaps, PCA plots, and other visual representations of the results.

Key Findings

Significant Genes: Identified genes with significant differential expression between invasive and non-invasive cancer types.

Model Performance: Best-performing model: Random Forest with an accuracy of 92%.

Biological Insights: Highlighted potential biomarkers for cancer invasiveness.
